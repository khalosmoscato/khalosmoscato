  <!-- to link the CSS file to HTML we use the <link> element. The link element uses 2 attributes, the first one is rel="type of file" (relation), as an example if we type stylesheet, it would tell we are going to open a CSS file. Second attribute is the href="", which also works with FILEPATH, so we are going to type the foldername followed by / followed by the name of the file. -->

<!-- void elemts are those elemts that do not requier a closing tag, such as <img> or <link>, the image tag which we use to add an image. With <img> we use: src="" / this will link the image we need to the img element. Normally we would put all the images we need for a project inside of a folder. In this case we called the folder "IMAGES". To locate the folder we type the name of it followed by a / symbol which tells vscode to look into the folder, and then we type the image name. Example: src="images/rock-emoji.png". This is called FILEPATH.
 
To make the code easier to read we separate the js and the css from html and then link them to the html. 

To link the js code we can use <script src="jscodefoldername"></script> / This is using FILEPATHS so we can also put our .js file into a folder. We can also use multiple scripts elemets and link our HTML to multiple .js files.

Example:
<script src="scripts/code1.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/code2.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/code3.js"></script>

We can also separate CSS. We can also put all of our CSS into a folder (called styles as an example) and use FILEPATH to link it to our HTML code.

We can link CSS files this way:
Example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/10-rock-paper-scissors.css">

Look above to find this <link> element into the HTML code and see more notes.

We can use multiple link elements to link multiple CSS files.
