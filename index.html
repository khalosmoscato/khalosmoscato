      <p>About me:</p>
      <p>My name is (Khalos) Calogero Filho Moscato, Italian Brazilian guy living in London since 2016.</p>
      <p>Tech is always been my passion, the video games, gadgets, how the internet works, etc... and I finally decided to learn how to code! </p>
      <p>I am very creative, I love helping people and working in a team as well as by myself.</p>
      <p> I have great problem solving skills thanks to my previous job experiecnes working as a Retail Manager, as well as interpersonal skills thanks to both my career and life (I am one of 8 siblings, communication was essential so that we could all grow up healthily under the same roof).</p>
      <p>On weekends I work part-time at Louis Vuitton, during the week days I self study HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I always wanted to learn coding, but I was scared I might be too old to go back to studying.</p>
      <p> Since I started working at LV I understood the importance of following my dreams! Thanks to the wonderful clients I meet every day, people that built their fortunes by cultivated their passions, no matter the age, inspiring me to do something I love and reach my goals.</p>
      <p>My hobbies are closely related to software development:
        <ul>
          <li>I love travelling, exploring, learning more about the world. This is what you do in Tech every day: always something new to learn, a new update, a new way of doing things, a new feature.</li>
          <li>I love playing piano and video games which helps my brain staying fresh: reading the music notes, remembering the melody, solving puzzles, understanding the right way to complete a level.</li>
          <li>I could watch documentaries every day, I like to get more knowledgable about the world around me, nature, politics, history, the universe and so on. This made me realise about my retail career so far, where most of the time I am using my interpersonal skills, but not so much other potential skills that I posses. It made me realise I want to learn how to build a website, a video game, using my full set of capabilities and creativity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The reason why I choose Founders&Coders are:
        <ul>
          <li>The course takes place in person, I normally learn better and faster when studying in person and engaging with my course mates.</li>
          <li>It is full time, Monday to Friday. This meets my requirements as I would like to learn coding full time and in depth.</li>
          <li>The team will assist me finding an internship or giving me advice for employability post bootcamp, this is essential as I am determined to transition to my new career as soon as possible and reach my goals!</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Thanks for taking time to read my description, I am looking forward to starting the course with you!</p>
